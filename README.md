# Teaching Collection

This is a Jekyll site built with *Facets* (see [Wax sites](https://minicomp.github.io\/wax/)). It allows users to browse through a collection of learning material created by Brock librarians using facets or filters. 

## Why does this site exist?

We want to get better at sharing the content that we've created with each other. Intranets are one option, but a publically accessible portal is even better. The cool thing about this webpage is that it doesn't have too many accoutrements â€” no databases, no spreadsheets, no SharePoint. It's a static website that offers relatively simple filtering options. This allows us to quickly locate content, download it, and remix it for our needs.

## How would I use this? Give me an example

Okay. Say you were asked to teach in a fourth year History classroom about primary sources. If you haven't done this before, you may have to create content from scratch. Luckily, a colleague has already created awesome content and has included it in the Teaching Collection. Using convenient facets, you select the "History" and "Upper-year" filter. In a few moments, you've identified appropriate, reusable content to remix for your lesson. Way to go ðŸ™Œ

## Who contributed content?

Brock University Teaching and Learning librarians have contributed content to this portal. We may open this up in the future to other librarians, but for now it's really just a place to store our stuff.

## How often is this updated?

It is regularly updated by @calmurgu, Instructional Design Librarian.
