# Teaching Collection

This is a Jekyll site built with *Facets* (see [Wax sites](https://minicomp.github.io\/wax/)). It allows allows users to browse through a collection of learning material created by Brock librarians using facets or filters. 

## Why does this site exist?

We want to get better at sharing the content that we've created with each other. Intranets are one option, but a publically accessible portal is even better. 

## Who contributed content?

Brock University Teaching and Learning librarians have contributed content to this portal. We may open this up in th future to other librarians, but for now it's really just a place to store our stuff.

## How often is this updated?

It is regularly updated by @calmurgu, Instructional Design Librarian.
